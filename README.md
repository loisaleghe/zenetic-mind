## streamlit custom components
1. streamlit itself is running some react process from your python
2. inject custom react component (my_component/frontend)
3. when testing
    1. `cd my_component/frontend` `npm i` `npm start`
    2. then run your streamlit app as normal
4. when ready to build
    1. need to build the frontend `npm run build`
    2. idK?
